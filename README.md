# Hootpile
Social utility for VITians, Hootpile is a great platform for
simplicity and Transparency.

It can be a tool for empowerment
and guess what
we respect your privacy.

 We believe that students should be provided with a common platform to discuss everything, build anything. Hootpile is free from advertising, manipulation and exploitation.

<br>
At Hootpile students share their notes with one another, teach each other. We know that every student in VIT is using different groups in facebook, whatsapp and we want to organize everything in one place. Students can ask questions to faculties and each faculty will have special privileges.
<br>
Various chapters/clubs can also join Hootpile and share directly with each student online.

While we realize this, we need your support to spread the word. Share Hootpile's Manifesto on your social networks and let's make this a great product.
